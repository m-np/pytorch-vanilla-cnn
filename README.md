**Objective:** A *simple* and *well-designed* template structure to start a machine learning/deep learning-based project. The template provides a basic directory structure with additional files (like [`notebooks/BOILERPLATE.ipynb`](./notebooks/BOILERPLATE.ipynb) to perform EDA. In addition, the template is designed such that code can be deployed into production. *Quickly get started* working on the code and preparing documentation as highlighted below. To understand the template check [**HOWTO.md**](./HOWTO.md) file.

<p align = "justify">AI-ML :brain: is an extremely fast-growing environment where millions of new commits :eye: and thousands of users :man: :woman: are actively engaging daily:calendar: To start a new project :package:, one should generally setup a basic project structure with some default branches and files. <a href = "https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository">GitHub Templates</a> solves this by setting up a template from an existing repositories. The template :receipt: provides minimalistic approach to start a machine learning/artificial intelligence project quickly. :gear:</p>

<p align = "justify">For more information :bulb: on how to use this template and get started, check <a href = "HOWTO.md">HOWTO</a>. Feel free to use the template as it suits you! :rocket:
It would be great if you :link: put a link to my template if you use this repository!

## :writing_hand: Project Name
